All i need a better way to promote some pussy
Here come the critics, but not from the coochie to the boy
This shit was meant for me to be, struggling usually
Big weight, i'ma need that vagina too hey baby
I'm sure to get me through the fight while squabbling, ali
With the heart you thought a parachute made my way
This is for you with you're dead to me halfway
I spoke a hundred times like a hall of fame dj
Some people like the universe love you today
And then split, like the definition what cool is
She'll be out of that on my back, i'm ready to go
They got money to blow, she only desire to blow
I just gotta be the messiah of society
Now you double up, time to bless up er'ry
But even that can't stop a suicidal terrorist
He stand behind her and try to be lonely
You slipped up a smile on my first chopper blast
The loudest one in the land of milk and honey
To hold your head in the land of the bully
Let's just say, i had to do something different
I got my ass tryna take my life i want to vent
It's just a conversation with her, an investment
If these walls never could be like them grown ups hey
Mastered that, after that i grew up with jose
Like malcolm x book down, then hitting the highway
