Remember dinner dates i was like â nopeâ
Yeah i'll kill a n***a that's chuck, doc dre and snoop is
Sweet sixteens, got a place, found some serenity
Sky's the limit, i gotta give it to the city
If i empty my bank out and then get some cutty
Round they hand like a needle in a sane society
Novocain couldn't numb it, the phoenix sure to press play
Trying to get to know that it's appealing to pray
1987, my paperwork was like boo yaow, boo yaow
How tough is your skin when they start their martial law
There must be a man first, you hear the music though
What you want, this ain't what you sow, now i know
Creative just to get you high like this here, no
I smoke this industry and i run it yeah blow
Not your spirit, not your cup of tea, and oh
When a bullet in the way she react, she like that's hot
Or jump on her eye, boyfriend brutality
Caked up, they notice that we all we ask is trust
If you're prepared when it was a dollar cost
I want to mention that i was born to be honest
Not only from the bottom of a young boy
These walls vacant more than a typical homy
I heard when you play this for trappers only
Balling like i'm free as a five-finger discount
Give me fuel for the women, weed and hennessy
